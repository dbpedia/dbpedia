  abstract = {Acquiring knowledge has long been the major bottleneck
	
	 preventing the rapid spread of AI systems. Manual
	
	 approaches are slow and costly. Machine-learning
	
	 approaches have limitations in the depth and breadth of
	
	 knowledge they can acquire. The spread of the Internet
	
	 has made possible a third solution: building knowledge
	
	 bases by mass collaboration, with thousands of
	
	 volunteers contributing simultaneously. While this
	
	 approach promises large improvements in the speed and
	
	 cost of knowledge base development, it can only succeed
	
	 if the problem of ensuring the quality, relevance and
	
	 consistency of the knowledge is addressed, if
	
	 contributors are properly motivated, and if the
	
	 underlying algorithms scale. In this paper we propose
	
	 an architecture that meets all these desiderata. It
	
	 uses first-order probabilistic reasoning techniques to
	
	 combine potentially inconsistent knowledge sources of
	
	 varying quality, and it uses machine-learning
	
	 techniques to estimate the quality of knowledge. We
	
	 evaluate the approach using a series of synthetic
	
	 knowledge bases and a pilot study in the domain of
	
	 printer troubleshooting.},

  title = {Agile Development of Diagnostic Knowledge Systems},
  school = {Bayerische Julius–Maximilians–Universität Würzburg},
  year = {2004},
  month = jul # {~21},
  abstract = {The success of diagnostic knowledge systems has been
	
	 proved over the last decades. Nowadays, intelligent
	
	 systems are embedded in machines within various domains
	
	 or are used in interaction with a user for solving
	
	 problems. However, although such systems have been
	
	 applied very successfully the development of a
	
	 knowledge system is still a critical issue. Similarly
	
	 to projects dealing with customized software at a
	
	 highly innovative level a precise specification often
	
	 cannot be given in advance. Moreover, necessary
	
	 requirements of the knowledge system can be defined not
	
	 until the project has been started or are changing
	
	 during the development phase. Many success factors
	
	 depend on the feedback given by users, which can be
	
	 provided if preliminary demonstrations of the system
	
	 can be delivered as soon as possible, e.g., for
	
	 interactive systems validation the duration of the
	
	 system dialog. This thesis motivates that classical,
	
	 document-centered approaches cannot be applied in such
	
	 a setting. We cope with this problem by introducing an
	
	 agile process model for developing diagnostic knowledge
	
	 systems, mainly inspired by the ideas of the eXtreme
	
	 Programming methodology known in software engineering.
	
	 The main aim of the presented work is to simplify the
	
	 engineering process for domain specialists formalizing
	
	 the knowledge themselves. The engineering process is
	
	 supported at a primary level by the introduction of
	
	 knowledge containers, that define an organized view of
	
	 knowledge contained in the system. Consequently, we
	
	 provide structured procedures as a recommendation for
	
	 filling these containers. The actual knowledge is
	
	 acquired and formalized right from start, and the
	
	 integration to runnable knowledge systems is done
	
	 continuously in order to allow for an early and
	
	 concrete feedback. In contrast to related prototyping
	
	 approaches the validity and maintainability of the
	
	 collected knowledge is ensured by appropriate test
	
	 methods and restructuring techniques, respectively.
	
	 Additionally, we propose learning methods to support
	
	 the knowledge acquisition process sufficiently. The
	
	 practical significance of the process model strongly
	
	 depends on the available tools supporting the
	
	 application of the process model. We present the system
	
	 family d3web and especially the system d3web.KnowME as
	
	 a highly integrated development environment for
	
	 diagnostic knowledge systems. The process model and its
	
	 activities, respectively, are evaluated in two real
	
	 life applications: in a medical and in an environmental
	
	 project the benefits of the agile development are
	
	 clearly demonstrated.},

	 This paper analyzes the topic of ontology versioning in

	 characteristics of the version relation between
	
	 ontologies and at the identification of online

	 web-based system that helps users to manage changes in
	
	 ontologies. The system helps to keep different versions
	
	 of web-based ontologies interoperable, by maintaining
	
	 not only the transformations between ontologies, but
	
	 also the conceptual relation between concepts in
	
	 different versions. The system allows ontology
	
	 engineers to compare versions of ontology and to
	
	 specify these conceptual relations. For the
	
	 visualization of differences, it uses an adaptable
	
	 rule-based mechanism that finds and classifies changes

	a detailed comparison of OIL, a proposal for expressing ontologies
	in the Web, with XML Schema, a proposed standard for describing
	the structure and semantics of XML based documents. We will argue
	that these two refer to different levels of abstraction, but that,
	in several cases, it can be advantageous to base a document schema
	on an ontology. Lastly, we will show how this can be done by providing
	an translation procedure from an OIL ontology to a specific XML
	Schema. This will result in a schema that can be used to capture
	instances of the ontology.},

  abstract = {Real-scale Semantic Web applications, such as
	
	 Knowledge Portals and E-Marketplaces, require the
	
	 management of large volumes of metadata, i.e.,
	
	 information describing the available Web content and
	
	 services. Better knowledge about their meaning, usage,
	
	 accessibility or quality will considerably facilitate
	
	 an automated processing of Web resources. The Resource
	
	 Description Framework (RDF) enables the creation and

	 voluminous RDF descriptions are already appearing,
	
	 sufficiently expressive declarative languages for
	
	 querying both RDF descriptions and schemas are still

	 (a la OQL) and relies on a formal model for directed
	
	 labeled graphs permitting the interpretation of

	 semistructured/XML query languages to the peculiarities
	
	 of RDF but, foremost, it enables to uniformly query

	 the commercial world versus the ``bazaar'' model of the

	 opposing assumptions about the nature of the
	
	 software-debugging task. I then make a sustained

	 that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'',
	
	 suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting

  month = may # {~28},
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {The response time of DSS (Decision Support System)
	
	 queries is typically several orders of magnitude higher
	
	 than the response time of OLTP (OnLine Transaction
	
	 Processing) queries. Since DSS queries are often
	
	 submitted interactively, techniques for reducing their
	
	 response time are becoming increasingly important. We
	
	 argue that caching of query results is one such
	
	 technique particularly well suited to the DSS
	
	 environment. We have designed a query cache manager for
	
	 such an environment. The cache manager can lookup query
	
	 results from the cache either based on an exact query
	
	 match or using a query split algorithm to efficiently
	
	 find query results which subsume the submitted query.
	
	 The cache manager dynamically maintains the cache
	
	 content by deciding whether a newly generated query
	
	 result should be admitted to the cache and if so, which
	
	 query results should be evicted from the cache to free
	
	 space for the new query result. The decisions are aimed
	
	 at minimizing the query response time. The decisions
	
	 are explicitly based on a cost function that considers
	
	 the execution cost of each query, the size of each
	
	 query result, the reference frequency to each result,
	
	 the cost of maintenance of each result due to updates
	
	 of the base tables, and the frequency of such updates.
	
	 Experimental evaluation shows that our cache manager
	
	 can improve performance on TPC-D like workloads.},
